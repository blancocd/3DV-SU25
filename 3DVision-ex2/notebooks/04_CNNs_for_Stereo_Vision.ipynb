    "# Part 04 – CNNs for Stereo Vision\n",
    "- In this notebook, you'll dive into the world of learning-based stereo matching. Instead of relying on hand-crafted cost functions, you'll design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly predict disparity maps from stereo image pairs, following the 'Fast Architecture' from the paper [Stereo Matching by Training a Convolutional Neural Network to Compare Image Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05970). This exercise will guide you through building a small neural network, training it on synthetic data, and evaluating its ability to estimate depth. Get ready to explore how deep learning can power 3D perception!"

    "## 1) The StereoPatchTripletDataset – Your Training Data Loader (5 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a neural network for stereo matching, we need a dataset that teaches the network to recognize which patches from two stereo images correspond to the same 3D point. This is exactly what the StereoPatchTripletDataset class provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will implement this custom PyTorch dataset to load training data for your CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👇 What this Dataset Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset returns ***triplets*** of image patches:\n",
    "- **Anchor** – a patch from the left image (view1.png)\n",
    "- **Positive** – a corresponding patch from the right image (view5.png) at the correct disparity (i.e. a matching patch)\n",
    "- **Negative** – a randomly chosen non-matching patch from the right image, at an incorrect disparity\n",
    "\n",
    "These triplets are ideal for training using contrastive or triplet loss, where the goal is to teach the network to bring matching patches closer in feature space and push non-matching ones apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Instructions for the implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down what happens in the __getitem__ method:\n",
    "1) Sample selection: A random image sample directory is selected from the dataset folder (e.g., sample_00001/) containing three files:\n",
    "    - view1.png – left image\n",
    "    - view5.png – right image\n",
    "    - disp1.png – ground truth disparity map for the left image\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Random pixel sampling: A valid pixel (x, y) is randomly chosen in the left image, ensuring it's not too close to the image borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Disparity lookup: The disparity value at (x, y) is read from disp1.png. This value tells us how far the corresponding pixel is shifted in the right image along the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Patch extraction:\n",
    "    - The anchor patch is extracted from view1 centered at (x, y).\n",
    "    - The positive patch is taken from view5, shifted left by the disparity amount.\n",
    "    - The negative patch is a randomly chosen patch from view5, offset by a random amount from the correct position (to simulate an incorrect match).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Sanity checks: If the chosen disparity is invalid or if any patch would go out of image bounds, the function retries by calling itself recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Normalization and tensor conversion: Each patch is normalized to [0, 1] and converted to a PyTorch tensor of shape [C, H, W].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why This is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset allows the network to learn from contrast. It sees:\n",
    "- What a good match looks like (anchor vs. positive),\n",
    "- What a bad match looks like (anchor vs. negative),\n",
    "\n",
    "And it adjusts its internal parameters to produce features that make this distinction easier."
